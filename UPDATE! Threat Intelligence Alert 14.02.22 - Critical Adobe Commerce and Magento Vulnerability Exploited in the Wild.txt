Update 18/02/2022:

On the 17th of February, Adobe released an update to CVE-2022-24086 pertaining to the affected versions of Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source and a new issue. This new issue has been assigned CVE-2022-24087 with the same CVSS score of 9.8, which can be have the same results as the original exploit when leveraged. Adobe have stressed that attempting to block exploitation attemps on a WAF is not a sufficient mitigation as the bug is exploitable "without specific and non-removable constructions in the request.”

Positive Technologies suggest that though a complete exploit has been described as "difficult" for threat actors to develop as technical details are not yet available, (they have no intention of releasing a PoC exploit), we should not underestimate motivated threat actor's determination and persistence.

This development further stresses the importance of updating these two products as soon as possible if in use.
