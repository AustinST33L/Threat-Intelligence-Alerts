# Threat Intelligence Alerts

Welcome to the NCC Group Threat Intelligence Alert repo, here you will find the alerts which we have raised to our customers regarding intelligence we have identified relating to emerging threats. As part of our mission to make the society more secure we want to make these alerts visible to all. 

Our Threat Intelligence team uses a range of sources and tools to monitor external reporting and carry out a daily review of this intelligence to identify changes to the threat landscape which requires action internally, whether this is in the form of additional monitoring of a developing situation, analysis of a new exploit or malware, 

The purpose of our Threat Intelligence Alerts are to:

•	Provide timely notification of an emerging threat

•	Detail mitigation steps that can be taken

•	Trigger internal efforts to develop detection measures and conduct threat hunting

•	Detail NCC Group actions taken and confirm detection coverage

While these alerts will often relate to vulnerabilities, they are triggered by the identification of threat actor activity e.g. mass scanning or reports of exploitation, or major cyber or geopolitical events.
